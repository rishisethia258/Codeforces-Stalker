## Problem We Aim to Solve
 We had an aim to make a webapp for people trying to master Competitive Programming. Here they can analyze and compare themselves with their friends. Also they can find a list mutually unattempted contests which they could give with virtual participation feature at codeforces.
 
## Future Prospects
* Add profiles for various other competitive programming websites such as Codechef, Atcoder etc.
* Recommend problems to users to work upon their weak areas.
* Add Rating Predictor.
* Add Animations to graphs.
